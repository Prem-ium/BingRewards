## Installation
The bot can be run using Python or Docker.

### Python Script
Run locally:
1. Clone this repository, cd into it, and install dependancies:
```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Prem-ium/BingRewards.git
   cd BingRewards
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your `.env` file (See below and example for options)
3. Run the script:
```sh
   python main.py
```

### Docker Container
View on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/nelsondane/bing-rewards)
1. Download and install Docker on your system
2. Configure your `.env` file (See below and example for options)
3. To start the bot using our prebuilt images:
 ```sh
   docker run -it --env-file ./.env --restart unless-stopped --name bing-rewards nelsondane/bing-rewards:<tag>
   ```
   To build the image yourself, cd into the repository and run:
   ```sh
   docker build -t bing-rewards .
   ```
   Then start the bot with:
   ```sh
   docker run -it --env-file ./.env --restart unless-stopped --name bing-rewards bing-rewards
   ```
   Both methods will create a new container called `bing-rewards`. Make sure you have the correct path to your `.env` file you created.

4. Let the bot log in and begin working. DO NOT PRESS `CTRL-c`. This will kill the container and the bot. To exit the logs view, press `CTRL-p` then `CTRL-q`. This will exit the logs view but let the bot keep running.

You can also open `DockerQuickstart.bat` in a text editor, edit the exisitng path in the file with your own of the BingRewards folder directory and run it to quickly stop and start docker container instances.

## Earning Potential:

Conservatively calculating potential points/earnings per month using this bot w/ a lvl 2 account:

PC Searches: (150 * 30) = 4500

Mobile Searches: (100 * 30) = 3000

Edge Bonus: (20*30) = 600

Daily Sets: (30*30) = 900


This adds up to 9000 points, conservatively (not accounting for streak bonuses or more activities which usually net very high, random amount of points), which ends up being a minimum of $6.92/per month per account on level 2. $34.61/ per month with an instance of 5 level 2 reward accounts.

## Notes:

- This bot uses the new $1.00 = 1300 points conversion rate. Older Bing Reward accounts may have the old conversion rate of $1.00 = 1050 points. As well as €1.00 = 1500 points conversion rate for Euro based Bing Reward accounts.
